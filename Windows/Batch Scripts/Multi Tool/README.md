## Multi Tool Script

I created this multi tool to house some of my portable apps and some other tools that I use from time to time.

This script was inspired by EbolaMan-YT and you can find his reposiotry here: https://github.com/EbolaMan-YT/Batch-Multi-Tool/tree/main

Please note this is still in progress and some things may or may not work properly.  Please veryify any script from the internet and don't run it unless you know exactly what it does.
