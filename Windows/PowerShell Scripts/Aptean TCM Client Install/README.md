## Aptean TCM Client Install Script

I spent many hours looking into this installation of this software all becase no one had any idea how to do this and they said it was impossible.  I proved them wrong and it made my life so much better and I wanted to share this project.

I have been using this installer for quite a while in PDQ Deploy but have recently modified it to PowerShell so others can use it that dont have PDQ. 

# Disclaimer

This is optized for Windows 10 and for TCM 10.2 however I have used a simular script on TCM 9.4 but it does require a bit of tweeking.

Like always be sure you understand what the script is doing before running it in your own enviornment.

Also, I assume all the install files for TCM are hosted on your "App Server" or TCM Server.

# How to use

First replace all the items surrounded by "[]" then run this scrip on a PC that you want the TCM client installed on.
